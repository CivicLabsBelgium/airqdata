# Air quality data

These scripts retrieve and process air quality data, mainly on particulate
matter, for the Civic Labs Belgium air quality project.

They
* wrap the APIs of various sources, including Civic Labs Belgium's Google
Sheets, luftdaten.info, madavi.de and irceline.be
* clean and combine the retrieved data
* analyze and visualize the data

The [demo.ipynb](https://github.com/dr-1/airqdata/blob/master/demo.ipynb)
notebook shows how the modules can be used.

Note that the API will evolve considerably over the coming weeks. In
particular, BaseSensor and BaseStation template classes will be introduced for
a cleaner and more consistent model of those real-world objects. This will make
it easier to compare sensors that belong to different organizations.

## Requirements
A Python 3.5+ environment is assumed. Several Python packages are required, see
requirements.txt. To install them, use Python's pip command or execute
install_requirements.sh, with elevated privileges
(`sudo ./install_requirements.sh`) if needed on your system.
